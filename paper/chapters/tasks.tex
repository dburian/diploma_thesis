\chapter{Tasks}

In this chapter we will describe the task we used to evaluate our model and
compare it to the rest.

\section{Classification}

\subsection{IMDB Sentiment Analysis}

In this task the model is asked to classify a piece of text based on sentiment.
The texts are anonymized reviews from the Internet Movie
Database\footnote{\url{www.imdb.com}} site collected together with their
human-annotated labels that classify the text into two categories: positive and
negative. The resulting dataset is commonly referred to as IMDB classification
or sentiment dataset~\cite{maas11}.

The dataset is split evenly to test and train set, each having 25000 reviews.
The label distribution in both sets is uniform, each of of the two labels is
represented by 12500 reviews.

As can be seen from the figure Figure~\ref{fig:imdb_word_token_dist} the reviews
are quite short with only 13.56\% being longer than 512 RoBerta tokens.
