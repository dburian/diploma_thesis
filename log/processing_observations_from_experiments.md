# Processing observations from experiments

I found that by doing detailed analysis, especially for experiments that you are
unfamiliar with (you've run it only once or twice), is not very helpful. I tend
to write a lot, but one tends to make assumptions/conclusions where one
shouldn't do. So you can end up with mix of misleading information and some
truths in a long text.

Instead I propose to:
- identify each experiment, so I can find all the results later (e.g. by a
  path on disk)
- date the experiment
- say what was the goal of the experiment
- write few lines of observations:
    - what I got from the experiment
    - what I think I should do next based on this experiment
    - perhaps some surprising observations
- If i need anything else I will come back to the experiment
