Here I note the things that I should probably mention, but are not directly
connected to my thing.


- Attempts to make with the 512 tokens BERT has to offer, instead of creating a
  model without quadratic complexity in the input length -- could probably be a
  baseline. E.g. SpanBERT, ORQA, REALM, RAG (BigBird's related work).
