# Baselines

We'd like to test how our model does in the given [tasks][d/datasets] compare to
other older models. The idea is to asses whether our model brings something new
to the table regarding long document embeddings.

In the ideal world we would compare our model to the existing techniques that
can embed long document embeddings. It is also beneficial to test
State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) models for given task to get the context of what is
possible.

## BOW models

- TF-IDF
- Pargagraph Vector
- doc2vec

## Short document embeddings

- SBert
