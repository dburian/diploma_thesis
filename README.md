> The dominant paradigm of information retrieval is to treat queries and
> documents as different kinds of objects, e.g., in keyword search. This
> paradigm, however, does not lend itself to exploratory search tasks. On the
> other hand, paradigms of search such Query by Example (QBE) which treat
> queries and documents as similar kinds of objects have been considered more
> suited to exploratory search tasks [41, 17, 45].
