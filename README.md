# Transformer document embedding

This is a repo containing everything connected to my thesis.

## Installation

This repo contains experiments with different models on different tasks. To run
these you need to install this python package. I recommend editable install to
be able to change the source files with:

```bash
pip install --editable .
```


## Structure of this repo

- `src` - source code for the experiments
- `notebooks` - jupyter notebooks either showcasing something or containing
  some really experimental code
- `paper` - latex source code of my thesis paper
- `notes` - my research notes,
- `log` - development logs (may contain some info but do not expect
  documentation),
